> This is a really nice recipe which is adapted from a friend's recipe. I found it really tasty and I think it's worth sharing.

### Ingredients

- 500g lentils soaked overnight
- 1 tbsp tomato puree 
- 1 can peeled tomato
- 1 tbsp ghee 
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 2 tsp sriracha sauce
- 4 shallots 
- 4 garlic cloves
- a few sage leaves
- 2 tsp coriander seed 
- 2 tsp mustard seed
- 1 cup red wine (good wine)
- 2 tsp sugar

3. Using a big pan on low-medium heat, melt the ghee meanwhile you crush the coriander and mustard seeds using a mortar
4. Mix the coriander, mustard and turmeric with the ghee and stir until aromatic

6. Add the lentils and the wine to the pan and bring the heat to medium-high
